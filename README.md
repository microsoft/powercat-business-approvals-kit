# Business Approvals kit for Microsoft Power Platform

One of the key use cases that we see across every industry and every department
are approvals. Power Automate allows you to streamline your business by
digitalizing the approval experience.

‚ÄúBusiness approvals kit‚Äù ‚Äì is a kit that will accelerate building your approvals
faster than ever - available as an experimental preview. Business approvals kit
is a no-code ready-made template built on top of Power Platform components that
allows your organization to configure sophisticated approvals such as
conditional branching, delegation, admin overrides and more ‚Äì all without the
need to write a single code ‚Äì empowering every person in your organization to
"do more with less" for your organizations approval needs.
