## Summary

In this module, you published new version of the business approval workflow. The first step was to add new request data variables for name and price. The price variable was used in a new Manager approval stage where the price was more than $400 to request and extra approval. The module then edited the **Machine request** cloud flow to use the new v2 workflow that includes the name and price variables. The **Machine Name** and **Price** were mapped as request data so that they could be used to supply data required by the workflow.
