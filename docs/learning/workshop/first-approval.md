> NOTE: If you do not have the Approvals Kit installed in your environment the [Approvals Kit Setup Guide](../../setup.md) or the [Instructor Guide](../instructor-guide/overview.md) could help your Center of Excellence team or Trainer provide an environment so that you can follow this workshop module

1. Select **Apps**, select the â€¦ button of the **Business Approval Management** and select **Play**.

1. If prompted select your account and enter your account password.

## Task 3 - Publish Approval Workflow

Having created the definition of your workflow, the next step is to publish the workflow so that you can trigger an approval when a Machine request is created. Everytime you publish the workflow, a new version is created.

1. Select **Publish**.

1. Verify that the workflow can be published and select **Publish**.

1. Wait for the workflow to be published. You can use the **Refresh** to update the publish status.

## Summary

In this module you stepped through the process of creating a Contoso Coffee Machine request, defined a simple Approval workflow and published the first version of this workflow.

The publish task created an active version of you work flow. As you change and adapt a workflow you can publish new versions to react to changing business rules or revert back to an earlier version.

The next [Trigger Approval](./trigger-approval.md) module will build on these two elements to use a Power Automate cloud flow to begin an approval workflow every time a Machine request is submitted.
