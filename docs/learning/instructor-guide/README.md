# Overview

These documents provide instructions on how to set up a development environment for learners to complete the [Approvals Kit in Power Automate workshop](https://aka.ms/approvals-kit/learn).

> Please note that these instructions have been scoped to work with a demo environment setup where the following conditions are true:
>
> 1. The logged-in Azure user has Global Administrator rights.
>
> 2. The user password for workshop users is known and can be stored in a local secure file with a key of DEMO_PASSWORD.
>
> It is important to note that further work would be required to investigate and expand the scope to apply the automated setup scripts to other environment scenarios where least privileges are needed or an interactive login is required for setup.
