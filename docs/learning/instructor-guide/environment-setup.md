# Environment setup

This section of the Power Platform Business Approvals kit focuses on creating isolated development environments for learners. 

## Prerequisites

- Complete the previous section [User setup](./user-setup.md), which explains how to create the Microsoft Entra ID users, groups, and assigned licenses.

## Create developer environments

To create the developer environment, use these steps to automate setup:

1. Create a developer environment for the learner.

1. Set the required environment settings.

1. Import the Creator Kit.

1. Import dependent solutions and components.

1. Import the Contoso Coffee Application from the Power Platform App in a day instructor download.

1. Install and set up the Approvals Kit.

1. Perform post-install steps of publishing applications and enabling flows.

## Single user setup (Bash Script)

1. Copy start script

```bash
cp ~/powercat-business-approvals-kit/Workshop/src/scripts/start.sh .
```

1. Enable execution of setup

```bash
chmod +x ~/setup.sh
```

1. Setup user

```bash
~/setup.sh adelev
```

1. Monitor the background task

```bash
tail -100 nohup.out
```

## Multiple user setup (Bash Script)

~/setup.sh ~/users.txt
```

```bash
tail -100 nohup.out
```

## Reset Developer Environments

1. Reset a single user
